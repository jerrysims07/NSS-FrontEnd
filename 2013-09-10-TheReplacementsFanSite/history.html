  The Replacements are an American rock band formed in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1979, and are considered[by whom?] pioneers of alternative rock. The band was composed of the guitarist and vocalist Paul Westerberg, guitarist Bob Stinson, bass guitarist Tommy Stinson and drummer Chris Mars for most of its career. Following several critically acclaimed albums, including Let It Be and Tim, Bob Stinson left the band in 1986 and the band experienced several line-up changes; Slim Dunlap joined as lead guitarist and Steve Foley replaced Mars in 1990. Towards the end of the band's career, Westerberg exerted more control over the creative output. The group disbanded in 1991, with the members ultimately pursuing various projects. However, a reunion was announced on October 3, 2012.[1] The Replacements never experienced any significant commercial success but did influence a variety of alternative rock acts.[citation needed]

  The Replacements' music was influenced by classic rock artists such as The Rolling Stones, Faces, Big Star, Slade, Badfinger, Lou Reed and The Beatles as well as punk rock bands such as The Ramones, Johnny Thunders, Dead Boys and The Clash. Unlike many of their underground contemporaries, the Replacements played "heart-on-the-sleeve"[2] rock songs that combined Westerberg's "raw-throated adolescent howl,"[3] with self-deprecating lyrics. The Replacements were a notoriously wayward live act, often performing under the influence of alcohol and trashing their instruments.
